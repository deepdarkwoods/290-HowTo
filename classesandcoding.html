   <h2>Dashboards</h2>
  <p>
   OK, now that we have learned how to setup a database connection and have an overview of the
   types of output we can get, let's look at how we can extend the built in classes provided by the
   library.
   <ul>     
      <li class="highlight">StandaloneDashboard</li>Default single wrapper
      <li class="highlight">EmbeddedDashboard</li>Add to your existing HTML or PHP page.
      <li class="highlight">TabbedDashboard</li>Dashboard is separated by a tab.
   </ul>
  </p>
  
   <h2>Components</h2>
   <p>Compoents are what is attached to the dashboard.</br>
      Component are one of the following:
      <ul>
         <li class="highlight">ChartComponent</li>
         <li class="highlight">FormComponent</li>
         <li class="highlight">GuageComponent</li>
         <li class="highlight">KPIComponent</li>
         <li class="highlight">TableComponent</li>         
      </ul>
   </p>
  
 <p>
   These three classes are extensions of a baseclass, Dashboard.
   We need to extend these classes as below:

      <strong>SampleDashboard</strong> can be any name you choose but the original Razorflow class has
      to be one of the three above.
 </p>
 <h2>Final Code</h2>
 <img class="screen" src="complete.jpg">
   <p>     
      We've already covered the Require statement, Class Extend, and the Database Portion.
     
      <h3>buildDashboard</h3>
      This is where we add the details of the Component, which could be anyone of the ones mentioned above.
      <ul>
         <li>setDashoardTitle</li>Pick a string to describe the dashboard (not the component).
         <li>new ChartComponent('c1')</li>Creates a new component. One of the list as stated above. You can choose the variable id ('c1')
         of the component.You won't need to reference it in this example, but is needed on more advanced features such as drill-down capabilities.
         <li>setCaption</li>Here's where you set the component title.
         <li>setDimensions</li>Phyisical size of the Chart. This has nothing to do with how many records to dipslay.
         <li>getSales()</li>this is where we run our database query and assign the results to the <strong>$top_customer</strong>object.
         <li>setLabels</li>This names the X-axis in the chart. The built-in static method 'pluck utility' pulls out the column values in a record.
         <li>addSeries</li>Here we actually add the data to the chart.First parameter is a unique id for the series that you choose.
         Second parameter is the name that will be diplayed on the chart. Third is the data.
         <li>addComponent</li>The chart is added to the component.        
      </ul>
      <p>
         Finally, we create an instance of the SampleDashboard class called $db.
         The renderStandalone method creates the Dashboard and chart.
