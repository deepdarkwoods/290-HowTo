   <h2>What you need to know</h2>
   <h3>Installation</h3>
   <p>After downloading the libraries from <a href="https://www.razorflow.com/download/">here</a>, the setup is documented midway
   down the page in the <a href="https://www.razorflow.com/docs/dashboard/php/getting_started_php.php">Getting Started</a> section. Basically, you need
   to place your libraries somewhere on your webserver to be accessed by your PHP file. You can install on either Linux, Windows, or Mac.
   Just make sure you get the php libraries as there is also a JavaScript Suite available.   
   </p>
   
   <h3>PHP Include File</h3>   
   <p>Open up a blank PHP file and save it in a web server folder.
   Only one file needs to be included at the top of your PHP file as seen below.<code> [razorflow.php] </code><br>
   I have the <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">XAMPP</a> standard package installed and using localhost for my server. I'm also showing the absolute path to the file for clarity.  
   </p>

   <h3>RazorFlow Components</h3>
   <p>All visual representations of data are distingued as five categories, referenced as Components. You can pick any combination
   of these to add to a Dashboard depending on your needs.This heiarchy was tricky for me to understand at first.<br>
   Components are added to Dashboards, not the other way around. If you thought of the Dashboard as a pizza, components would be the toppings.
   <ul>
      <li class="highlight">Chart Component</li>Just as it sounds. Pie, Bar Charts, Etc.<br><br>
      <img src="chart_pie.jpg"> 
      <li class="highlight">Form Component</li>User input forms such as Text, Number, & Dropdowns.<br><br>
      <img src="form.jpg">
      <li class="highlight">Guage Component</li>Measuring one piece of data. An example would be 'Total Monthly Sales';<br><br>
      <img src="gauge.jpg">
      <li class="highlight">KPI Component</li>"Key Performance Indicators" - show current values of multiple important metrics.<br><br>
      <img src="kpi_table.jpg">
      <li class="highlight">Table Component</li>Formatted tables. This could be used to show records in a database.<br><br>
