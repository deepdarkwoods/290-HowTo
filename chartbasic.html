   <h2>What you need to know</h2>
   <h3>Installation</h3>
   <p>After downloading the libraries from <a href="https://www.razorflow.com/download/">here</a>, the setup is documented midway
   down the page in the <a href="https://www.razorflow.com/docs/dashboard/php/getting_started_php.php">Getting Started</a> section. Basically, you need
   to place your libraries somewhere on your webserver to be accessed by your PHP file. You can install on either Linux, Windows, or Mac.
   Just make sure you get the php libraries as there is also a JavaScript Suite available.   
   </p>
   
   <h3>PHP Include File</h3>   
   <p>
   Only one file needs to be included at the top of your PHP file as seen below.<br>
   I have the XAMPP standard package installed and using localhost for my server.I'm also showing the absolute path to the file for clarity.  
   </p>

   <h3>Components</h3>
   <p>All visual representations of data are distingued as five categories,referenced as Components.
   <ul>
      <li class="highlight">Chart Component</li>Just as it sounds.Pie, Bar Charts, Etc.
      <li class="highlight">Form Component</li>User input forms.Text,Number,& Dropdowns.
      <li class="highlight">Guage Component</li>Measuring one piece of data.An example would be 'Total Monthly Sales';
      <li class="highlight">KPI Component</li>"Key Performance Indicators" Show current values (not very visual) of multiple important metrics.
      <li class="highlight">Table Component</li>As expected, a nicely formatted table. Could be used to show record in a database.
   </ul>
